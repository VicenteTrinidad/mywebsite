Due to the increased enrolment indicative of its success, the site was transferred to a hilltop near the church. This paved way for a greater commitment of the school to the community and gave birth to Iguig Municipal High School following its ground breaking which was materialized on February 14, 1970. The designated date to commemorate the founding anniversary of the school.”</h3>
